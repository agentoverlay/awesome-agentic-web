## Concepts (Core Foundations of the Agentic Web)

These are foundational themes and abstractions that underpin an **Agentic Web**, focusing on *what must be true* rather than *which protocol does it*.

### Identity & Authority

* **Agent Identity** — A structured representation of “who or what” an agent is (e.g. credentials, decentralized identifiers, attestation).
* **Delegation & Authority Transfer** — Manner in which agents can grant limited rights or act on behalf of others (humans, agents) under scoped constraints.
* **Reputation & Trust Signals** — Continuous feedback, endorsements, and reputation systems that inform how agents are trusted or distrusted.

### Autonomy & Intent

* **Goal Representation & Planning** — How agents define, decompose, and pursue objectives in dynamic settings.
* **Decision & Strategy** — Balancing exploration, risk, uncertainty, multi-agent coordination, and adaptation.

### Security, Safety & Governance

* **Runtime Guarantees & Enforcement** — Mechanisms ensuring agents adhere to policy, safety constraints, or regulatory rules.
* **Trust Boundaries & Isolation** — Defining zones where agents can operate, and preventing cross-contamination of influence, privileges, or data.
* **Accountability & Auditability** — Traceability, logs, and verifiable evidence of agent decisions and their consequences.

### Interaction & Orchestration

* **Inter-agent Communication** — Mechanisms for negotiation, information exchange, protocol mediation, and coordination abstractly defined.
* **Orchestration & Mediation** — How multiple agents collaborate under shared objectives, roles, task allocation, and conflict resolution.
* **Contextual Adaptation** — Agents adjusting or reinterpreting their behavior based on environmental signals, past interactions, or evolving norms.

### Evaluation & Simulation

* **Sandboxing & Simulation** — Virtual environments to test agent behavior before deployment in the real world.
* **Performance, Safety, and Robustness Metrics** — Quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate agent behavior (efficiency, fairness, safety, resilience).
* **Digital Twins & Environment Models** — Simulated analogues of real systems to plan, project, and validate agent actions.

## Taxonomy Commentary

This map is intended to show how the core concept domains interlock:

1. **Identity & Authority** — Who is the agent? Who grants what powers?
2. **Autonomy & Intent** — What is the agent trying to achieve, and how?
3. **Security, Safety & Governance** — Under what bounds can the agent operate securely and responsibly?
4. **Interaction & Orchestration** — How do agents coordinate, negotiate, and cooperate in a shared ecosystem?
5. **Evaluation & Simulation** — How do we test, validate, and iterate agent behaviors before full deployment?
